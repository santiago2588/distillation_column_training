Welcome to the Distillation Yield Predictor! This application uses a machine learning model to forecast the production yield of a chemical product from a distillation column based on key operational parameters.

### What is Distillation?
Distillation is a widely used industrial process to separate liquid mixtures based on differences in their boiling points. By carefully controlling temperature, pressure, and flowrate, we can isolate and purify valuable chemical components.

**This tool can help process engineers and operators to:**
- **Optimize** operating conditions for maximum yield.
- **Predict** the impact of process changes before implementation.
- **Troubleshoot** potential issues by simulating different scenarios.

    **How does it work?**

    1.  **Input Data:** You provide the key operational parameters (flowrate, temperature, and pressure) using the sliders in the sidebar.
    2.  **Prediction:** The pre-trained machine learning model receives these inputs. It analyzes them based on the patterns learned from historical data to calculate the expected yield.
    3.  **Output:** The app displays the final predicted yield as a percentage, giving you an estimate of the column's efficiency under the specified conditions.

    **Model Details:**

    * **Model Type:** `Regression Model` (likely from the scikit-learn library)
    * **Purpose:** To predict the continuous value of the distillation yield.
    * **Features Used:** Feed Flowrate, Reboiler Temperature, and Pressure Difference.
