Welcome to the Distillation Yield Predictor! This application uses a machine learning model to forecast the production yield of a chemical product from a distillation column based on key operational parameters.

### What is Distillation?
Distillation is a widely used industrial process to separate liquid mixtures based on differences in their boiling points. By carefully controlling temperature, pressure, and flowrate, we can isolate and purify valuable chemical components.

**This tool can help process engineers and operators to:**
- **Optimize** operating conditions for maximum yield.
- **Predict** the impact of process changes before implementation.
- **Troubleshoot** potential issues by simulating different scenarios.
